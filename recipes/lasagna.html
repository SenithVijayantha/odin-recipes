        <h3>Lasagna Recipe</h3>
        <p><strong>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato<br>
            sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a<br>
            casserole. Here's the run-down:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> 
                with ground beef, bell peppers,
                <br> onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and 
                <br>crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the<br> 
                sauce great depth of flavor.<br>
                <br>

            <strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the<br>
            cheeses ready.</strong>
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and<br>
            parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend<br>
            gives the lasagna great flavor!<br>
            <br>
            <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> <br>
            A cup of meat sauce, a<br>
            layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese.<br>
            Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the<br>
            ingredients.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></p>
